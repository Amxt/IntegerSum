## Integer Count

I wrote this about 2 weeks after I had written my first ever line of code. It counts the integers between and including the two integer numbers that are provided to it e.g if the numbers 5 and 8 are entered, the program will add 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 and the output will be 26. The order that the integers are entered will not change the result. Non-integer values entered will not be excepted.
